# LeetCode
My LeetCode progress, solutions and documentation.

📘 Documenting my solutions to LeetCode problems in C++, Java, and Python — organized by topic and difficulty.


## 🔍 Structure

- Topic-first (arrays, strings, trees, etc.)
- Then subfolders for easy/medium/hard
- Each problem folder includes:
  - Code in `.cpp`, `.java`, `.py`
  - A `README.md` explaining the approach and complexities
